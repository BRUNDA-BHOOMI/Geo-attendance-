# Geo-attendance 
This repository contains the source code and documentation for a Geolocation-Based Attendance Tracking Mobile Application. The project was developed as part of a Mini Project for the Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science and Engineering at Sri Venkateshwara College of Engineering, affiliated with Visvesvaraya Technological University (VTU), Belgaum.

üìå Project Overview
=>The application simplifies attendance and leave management in workplaces by leveraging geolocation technology. It allows employees to:

-Check in/out automatically when entering or leaving a predefined office location.

-Managing attendance records.
-Generating and downloading reports.
-Approving/rejecting leave requests.

üèóÔ∏è Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS), JavaScript
Backend: Flask (Python)
Database: MongoDB
